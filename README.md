# GovHack 2017

## Team Name: Chadjango

## Members: Chad Gay, Brody Ly, Michael Esteban

### We have built a web app designed to assist patrons who will be attending the Commonwealth Games.

### The app aims to display the main sites of the game, and free pubic amenities that are nearby such as water fountains, bicycle racks and showers. When an amenity is clicked on, the street view is shown to give the user a better indication of its location

### The tool currently supports Gold Coast data on public drinking fountains, bicycle racks and showers. Further data sets could be easily added.
